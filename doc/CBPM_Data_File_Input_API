CBPM File Input API Specification
 Document Rev 8 : 23-Nov-2011
-----------------------------------

The CBPM data file input routines provide a standardized method of accessing collections of
data on disk and storing them in an easily accessed way in local application memory for
later use.


Prerequisites:
----------------
Your BASH shell-compatible environment must be set up to contain the laboratory's ACC build
system environment variables.
In order to do this one must invoke:
ACC_SETUP_SCRIPT=/nfs/acc/libs/util/acc_vars.sh
if ( [ -f ${ACC_SETUP_SCRIPT} ] ); then
    source ${ACC_SETUP_SCRIPT}
fi
A good place for this is in a user's login script such that upon spawning a new terminal,
the user's environment is configured to use the default, stable ('current') release of
pre-built accelerator libraries and applications.


This API is part of a set of libraries that must be linked against when using it in an 
applicaiton.  In order to use the standardized file input routines for CBPM turn-by-turn/RAW
data files one must link against all the supporting software libraries required for the
mechanism as well.  This mechanism is spread across several supporting libraries.  This means 
one must link against the following libraries in the order in which they appear here when
building an application that will use this file input system.
  GTK+
  c_utils
  cbi_net
  mpmnet
  BeamInstSupport
  CBPM-TSHARC 

A good starting CESR_LIBS list to include in one's makefile is:
CESR_LIBS  := CBPM-TSHARC BeamInstSupport mpmnet cbi_net c_utils

A helpful list of LOCAL_INCS to have for correct building and linking is:
LOCAL_INCS    := CBPM-TSHARC/include CBPM-TSHARC/comm_include BeamInstSupport/include BeamInstSupport/cesr_intf_include BeamInstSupport/comm_include c_utils/include cfortran/include mpmnet/include cbi_net/include

This linking arrangement may be streamlined to a shorter list in the future, but for the 
time being all of these are required.

Also, in order to avoid errors when looking for symbols from the GTK+ libraries, you must
add the following phrases to your makefile(s):

  If using the ACC build system, the makefile(s) will contain a line starting with
  "LOCAL_CFLAGS".
    Add 
  `pkg-config --cflags gtk+-2.0`
  to this line.  The tick marks are required.

  The makefile should also contain a line starting with
  "LOCAL_LFLAGS"
    Add
  `pkg-config --libs gtk+-2.0`
  to this line.  Again, the tick marks are required.



Headers to include in your code:
-----------------------------------
In order to access crucial named constants for file reading operation, you must #include
the BeamInstSupport and CBPM-TSHARC header files
  #include "cbi_io_constants.h"
     and
  #include "cbpm_io_constants.h" 
These headers provide the values of CBI_MAX_NAME_CHARS, CBPM_HORZ_DIM, and CBPM_VERT_DIM.

The CBPM data file input MATLAB language API for Developers consists of the following functions:
(All of these functions are provided via MATLAB MEX wrapper functions.  Library loading
and initialization MATLAB code is provided.)
NOTE:  Until further notice, the MATLAB support for this file input mechanism is 
       supported only for 32-bit matlab executables!  Matlab can be run on any machine,
       but a -glnx86 flag should be used to ensure this mechanism loads correctly.
       Proper 64-bit support is pending and will be noted here in the future.

Currently Matlab must be run in 32 bit mode, so matlab must be called with the glnx86 flag.

===================================================================================

For a given language, the API is divided into two parts.
  1) The data reading mechanism:  Reads data from disk and stores in a system of
     internal data structures for later referencing.
  2) 'Accessor' functions either return:
          a) copies of data values directly
                - or -
          b) references (pointers) to the start of pre-allocated multi-value data 
             buffers

===================================================================================

Part 1 - Read (Import) Functions

There are two styles of Import functions.  The first takes a file index value and
attempts to retrieve the file with that index from the CESR ONLINE data storage
area.  Failing that, it will try the CESR OFFLINE data storage area before throwing
an error.

The other style allows for the specfication of the full path of the file name to
allow reading in data files that do not happen to live in the standardized CESR
NFS data directories.

For Fortran code:
  The following statements must appear at the beginning of any code that uses this
  API in order to correctly utilize the modules provided for the functions described
  below.
    use cbpm_read_rawfile_f_mod
    use cbpm_io_utils_f_mod



int     cbpm_read_rawfile( int *file_idx )
Function cbpm_read_rawfile_f( file_idx ) result (retval)

Arguments:
    - Pointer to integer representing the RAW data file index to load.

Return value:
    0 (CBI_F_SUCCESS) - If function completed successfully.
    6 (CBI_F_FAILURE) - If function experienced an error opening the file.


int     cbpm_read_rawfile_by_name( char *full_filename, int len )
Function cbpm_read_rawfile_by_name_f( filename ) result (retval)
  
  Arguments:
    - In C:       NULL-terminated string describing the full path of the data file
                  to read.
      In Fortran: A standard space-padded string is the argument.

  Return value:
    0 (CBI_F_SUCCESS) - If function completed successfully.
    6 (CBI_F_FAILURE) - If function experienced an error opening the file.

The "by_name" function reads in selected content from a given data file on disk.
The full path and file name must be given as a string argument.  This function
will return a status of CBI_F_SUCCESS if the data importation operation completed
successfully and CBI_F_FAILURE otherwise.

These import functions also sets up all the necessary memory locations/structures
for storing and using the imported data in a manageable way, facilitated by the
accessor functions described below.



Note:
The internal data structures that hold raw data, and the structures that
contain automatically calculated values based on this raw data (scaled button values,
X/Y positions, etc...) are populated upon every call to cbpm_read_rawfile.  The data
will need to be copied to another location provided by the developer if one wishes to
preserve a particular set of data when a new call to cbpm_read_rawfile is made.


===================================================================================

Part 2 - Accessors
  Once the data has been imported and supplementary data buffers automatically
calculated, one may access any of these values by using the appropriate accessor
function.


int      cbpm_rawfile_timestamp_( char *timestamp )
Function cbpm_rawfile_timestamp_f( timestamp ) result (retval)
function string = cbpm_raw_timestamp_m( )

   Returns a timestamp string containing the time the measurement was performed.
   The string returned has a maximum length of CBI_MAX_STRING_LENGTH.
  



int      cbpm_rawfile_num_instruments_( void )
Function cbpm_rawfile_num_instruments_f( ) result (retval)
function scalar = cbpm_raw_num_instruments_m( )
  
   Returns the number of instruments that provided data for the measurement




int      cbpm_rawfile_num_bunches_( void )
Function cbpm_rawfile_num_bunches_f( ) result (retval)
function scalar = cbpm_raw_num_bunches_m( )

   Returns the number of bunches acquired in the measurement data file.




int      cbpm_rawfile_num_turns_( void )
Function cbpm_rawfile_num_turns_f( ) result (retval)
function scalar = cbpm_raw_num_turns_m( )

  Returns the number of turns acquired for each bunch in the imported
  measurement data.




int      cbpm_rawfile_condx_number_( void )
Function cbpm_rawfile_condx_number_f( ) result (retval)
function scalar = cbpm_raw_condx_number_m( )

   Returns the CESR conditions (CONDX) file index value in place when the measurement
   was taken.

   The CONDX number is the value obtained from the node "RELATED SETS" element 12 in 
   the CESR database.




float    cbpm_rawfile_cern_current_( void )
Function cbpm_rawfile_cern_current_f( ) result (retval)

  Returns a floating point value representing the CESR CERN total current measurement.




int      cbpm_rawfile_inst_names_( char *name )
Function cbpm_rawfile_inst_names_f( name ) result (retval)

  Upon each call, returns a single pointer (string) to the ID / location string 
  of the next instrument found in the data file.  "name" will be NULL (blank string
  for Fortran) for the call made immediately after the last ID string pointer has
  been returned from the file.  At this point, the caller will have seen every
  instrument name present in the data file.  There is no need to make another call
  until cbpm_read_rawfile is called for a different data file.  If this function is 
  called again after returning a NULL or blank string, it will simply start the 
  instrument name listing process again returning names starting from the 
  beginning of the file and iterating through them.
  
  Name strings are of the form "12W", "12W2", "8AW", "21E", etc...

  Arguments:
    - Pointer to string able to receive an instrument name by action of this
      function.




int      cbpm_rawfile_rf_bucket_( int *bunch )
Function cbpm_rawfile_rf_bucket_f( bunch) result (retval)

  Returns the CESR RF bucket number for the bunch index provided.
  The bunch indexing is dependent upon the timing setup that the
  instrument was in when the measurement was taken.  This function
  takes that fact into account automatically.

  Arguments:
    - bunch index (by reference)




float cbpm_rawfile_pedestal_( char *inst_location, int *bunch, int *button )
Function cbpm_rawfile_pedestal_( inst_location, bunch, button ) result (retval)

  Returns the pedestal value stored for the given bunch index and button.

  Arguments:
    - Pointer to the instrument ID / location string for the BPM desired
    - Bunch index (First bunch acquired is index 1)
    - Button index (0,1,2,3)




float cbpm_rawfile_gain_factor_( char *inst_location, int *bunch, int *button ) 
Function cbpm_rawfile_gain_factor_( inst_location, bunch, button ) result (retval)

  Returns the gain scale factor stored for the given bunch index and button.

  Arguments:
    - Pointer to the instrument ID / location string for the BPM desired
    - Bunch index (First bunch acquired is index 1)
    - Button index (0,1,2,3)




int      cbpm_rawfile_raw_ptr_( char *inst_location, int *button, int *dat_ptr )
Function cbpm_rawfile_raw_ptr_f( inst_location, button, dat_ptr ) result (retval)

  Returns an integer pointer (array) to the first buffer location of a particular BPM's 
  signal input buffer (i.e. button).  These values are the RAW ADC values acquired.

  Data organization:
  The data are ordered in the following fashion
  For each bunch that is digitized, the data for all turns appears in order, then
  so on for each subsequent bunch.  This scheme applies to raw data obtained via this
  function as well as turn-by-turn (TBT, ped-subtracted and scaled) data, and position
  data accessed by the next several functions described below.

  Arguments:
    - Pointer to the instrument ID / location string for the BPM desired
    - Pointer to integer value for the button (card) from where the data came.
       Valid values are  <0, 1, 2, 3>
    - Pointer to (int) data array to fill





int      cbpm_rawfile_tbt_ptr_( char *inst_location, int *button, int *dat_ptr )
Function cbpm_rawfile_tbt_ptr_f( inst_location, button, dat_ptr ) result (retval)

  Returns a float pointer (array) to the first buffer location of a particular BPM's
  signal input buffer (i.e. button).  These values are PEDESTAL-SUBTRACTED and 
  GAIN-SCALED already, i.e. in "physics units".

  Data organization:
  The data are ordered in the following fashion
  For each bunch that is digitized, the data for all turns appears in order, then
  so on for each subsequent bunch.

  Arguments:
    - Pointer to the instrument ID / location string for the BPM desired
    - Pointer to integer value for the button (card) from where the data came.
       Valid values are  <0, 1, 2, 3>
    - Pointer to (float) data array to fill





int      cbpm_rawfile_pos_ptr_( char *inst_location, int *plane, int *dat_ptr )
Function cbpm_rawfile_pos_ptr_f( inst_location, plane, dat_ptr ) result (retval)

  Returns a float pointer (array) to the first buffer location of a particular BPM's
  position value for the plane specified, either horizontal or vertical.
  The positions are not stored in the data file, but are calculated and stored
  in memory upon execution of the Part 1 import function.  The positions are
  calculated for every turn acquired using the fully corrected PEDESTAL-SUBTRACTED
  and GAIN-SCALED values for the gain setting employed during acquisition.

  Data organization:
  The data are ordered in the following fashion
  For each bunch that is digitized, the data for all turns appears in order, then
  so on for each subsequent bunch.

  Arguments:
    - Pointer to the instrument ID / location string for the BPM desired
    - Integer value for the transverse plane of beam displacement to access
       Valid values are  <CBPM_HORZ_DIM, CBPM_VERT_DIM>
    - Pointer to (float) data array to fill




int      cbpm_rawfile_phase_ptr_( char *inst_location, int *plane, int *dat_ptr )
Function cbpm_rawfile_phase_ptr_f( inst_location, plane, dat_ptr ) result (retval)

  Returns an integer pointer (Array) to the first buffer location (first turn) of a 
  particular BPM's encoded shaker phase word.  This is the bit pattern encoded onto
  the command word embedded into the CESR clock signal turns marker burst.  
  The bit pattern is made available in two parts, one for the encoded horizontal
  shaker phase and the other for vertical.

  Data organization:
  The data are ordered in the following fashion
  For each bunch that is digitized, the data for all turns appears in order, then
  so on for each subsequent bunch.

  Arguments:
    - Pointer to the instrument ID / location string for the BPM desired
    - Integer value for the transverse plane of shaker phase to access
       Valid values are  <CBPM_HORZ_DIM, CBPM_VERT_DIM>
    - Pointer to (float) data array to fill






Below are valid code examples that can be used in a main routine for demonstrating
file input mechanics.

The example programs live in CBPM-TSHARC and can be build with the ACC build system
by invoking gmake -f M.C_input_test  or  gmake -f M.F_input_test for C and Fortran
programs, respectively.

Functioning makefiles for these examples can be found in the ACC release's 
${ACC_REL}/src/CBPM-TSHARC directory.
